## Available Agent Skills

Skills are located in:
- Global: `~/.config/zed/skills/<skill-name>/`
- Worktree-specific: `<worktree>/.agents/skills/<skill-name>/`

Each skill contains:
- `SKILL.md` - Main instructions
- `scripts/` - Executable scripts
- `references/` - Additional documentation
- `assets/` - Templates, data files, images

To use a skill, you should use the read_file and list_directory tools to explore skill files, and only use bash for running executable scripts:

**For reading and exploring (use internal tools):**
- Read SKILL.md: `read_file` with path `~/.config/zed/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- List skill references: `list_directory` with path `~/.config/zed/skills/<skill-name>/references/`
- List skill scripts: `list_directory` with path `~/.config/zed/skills/<skill-name>/scripts/`
- Read references: `read_file` with path `~/.config/zed/skills/<skill-name>/references/doc.md`

**For running scripts only (use bash):**
- Run scripts: `bash ~/.config/zed/skills/<skill-name>/scripts/script.sh`

Note: You typically want to run tools for the current project you're working on, which is why you should use your worktree root as the working directory.

When a skill is relevant to the user's request:
1. **Always start here:** Read SKILL.md to load the skill's instructions using `read_file` with path `~/.config/zed/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
2. **Then, based on the instructions in SKILL.md and the user's specific needs:**
   - Use `list_directory` to explore available resources
   - Use `read_file` to read reference files
   - Use `bash` only to run executable scripts
